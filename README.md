# CryptoClustering
This project focuses on clustering cryptocurrency market data using K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal is to group cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages over various time periods, such as 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, and more. The analysis explores the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering results by comparing the performance of K-Means on the original dataset versus the PCA-transformed dataset. The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, hvplot, and scikit-learn.
The dataset, crypto_market_data.csv, contains price change percentages for multiple cryptocurrencies over different time frames. The data is first normalized using StandardScaler to ensure all features are on the same scale. The optimal number of clusters (k) is determined using the Elbow method, which involves plotting the inertia (sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center) for different values of k. The analysis reveals that the optimal number of clusters is 4 for both the original and PCA-transformed data.
After determining the optimal k, K-Means clustering is performed on the original dataset, and the results are visualized using scatter plots. The data is then transformed using PCA to reduce its dimensionality to three principal components, which retain 89.5% of the variance. The clustering process is repeated on the PCA-transformed data, and the results are compared to those obtained from the original dataset. The scatter plots for both datasets show clear clustering patterns, confirming that PCA effectively preserves the essential structure of the data while reducing its complexity.
This project is a great example of how dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA can enhance the efficiency and interpretability of clustering algorithms without significantly altering the results. The code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to reproduce and modify for similar analyses.
